# donationeasy_bot

Hi there! 

This bot is a part of my college project for Project Management class. It's a Telegram bot with a questionaire that asks the user question about their health status in order to evaluate whether they are allowed to donate blood. 

We do not store any of the answers. The bot is a simple yes-no quiz. 

I'm planning to add a few extra features, but that's for another day. 

**WARNING**
The project has constants.py file in the .gitignore. This file has links and bot IP so that's pretty obvious why I don't wanna share it. If you want to grab some of my code, keep that in mind.
